    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Make the holiday morning breakfast extra special with this delicious sausage breakfast casserole.

        <li>8 ounces mild Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Brown the sausage and drain the excess grease.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the mustard powder, egg, salt, and milk.</li>
